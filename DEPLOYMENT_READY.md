   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/legastream.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Railway**:
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Add environment variables (see DEPLOYMENT_QUICK_START.md)

3. **Done!** Railway gives you a public URL

## 🌐 Platform Comparison

| Platform | Setup Time | Cost | Best For |
|----------|------------|------|----------|
| **Railway** | 10 min | $5-10/mo | Quick start, easy scaling |
| **Render** | 15 min | Free-$7/mo | Budget-conscious |
